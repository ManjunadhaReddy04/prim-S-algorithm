AIM
To Find Minimum Cost Spanning Tree of a undirected graph using Primâ€™s algorithm
ALGORITHM
1.	Step 1: Select a starting vertex  
2.	Step 2: Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until there are fringe vertices  
3.	Step 3: Select an edge 'e' connecting the tree vertex and fringe vertex that has minimum weight  
4.	Step 4: Add the selected edge and the vertex to the minimum spanning tree T  
5.	[END OF LOOP]  
6.	Step 5: EXIT
